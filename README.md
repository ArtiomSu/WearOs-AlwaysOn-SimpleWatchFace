# SimpleWatchFace

This WearOs watch face aims to be always on forever. So you can always see the seconds tick by no matter what.

It does not turn off the screen at all after enabling some settings in the watch face itself since if you want to use it normally those settings are enabled by default.

#### To access the settings simply tab anywhere on the watch face.

## Features / Settings
You can see the screenshots bellow of every feature

- Hide Elements - allows you to hide every single element individually except for the time.
- Always On - enable this if you don't want the watch to go into ambient mode ( in ambient mode it won't update the time every second )
- Enable Wakelock - with always on enabled the watch will turn off the display after about an hour. This setting will force the watch to remain on forever. So if you are using it like a "normal clock" on your desk like me then enable this.
- Custom Color - when enabled it will display a colour picker and you can choose what color you want the text. Toggling this off will set the color back to white.
- RGB Animation - when enabled the colour will be animated in a rgb rainbow type of effect.
